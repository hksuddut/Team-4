To explain how an open source software can be used to replace a normal software.

Desired End Result
We, as a team, will attempt to show that open-source word-processing software has a place in first year writing courses, despite the courses currently being dominated by word processors such as Microsoft Word and Google Docs.
We plan to create an informative outline targeted at first-year college students that will aim to explain how to use LibreOffice in a Microsoft Office dominated university, with an emphasis on Microsoft Office compatibility and overall usefulness in 100-level writing courses. We plan to create a guidebook-like series of documents within this repository, including a table of contents, in-depth explanation of basic functions within an open-source word-processor, and images to supplement this content, as well. 

Reporting Plan
Weekly progress reports are created to allow the teacher and members know if we are on track

#  **PROJECT OUTLINE**

## **Introduction**

### **Purpose**
To create an informative outline targeted at first-year college students that will aim to explain how to use LibreOffice  in a Microsoft Office dominated university, with an emphasis on Microsoft Office compatibility and overall usefulness in 100-level writing courses.

### **Audience**
College students enrolled in a first-year writing seminar in which open-source software, such as LibreOffice’s Writer, can be used to serve as a student’s primary word processing application.

# **Beginning of Draft Content**

## **What is LibreOffice?**

### **Who was it created by?**
__LibreOffice__ is a continuation and reoptimization of the Apache OpenOffice open-source word processing platform by __The Document Foundation__. __The Document Foundation__ is a non-profit organization that promotes open-source document handling software. The __LibreOffice__ suite comprises programs for word processing, the creation and editing of spreadsheets, slideshows, diagrams and drawings, working with databases, and composing mathematical formulae. It is available in over 110 languages.

### **When was it created?**
The initial release date for __LibreOffice__ was January 25th, 2011. Forked from [OpenSource.org](https://opensource.org/) in 2010. 

### **Why was it created?** (purpose)
__LibreOffice__ was created so that free and open-source software could continue to serve those in place of popular word-processors. Created also for individuals needing an alternative to __Microsoft Office__, as __LibreOffice__ is extremely similar to __Microsoft Office__. 

## ***How to download LibreOffice***

## **Basic Tools in __LibreOffice__**

### **Home Page** (Elaborate on what each tab offers)

#### **Open File**
This tab functions in the same way that opening a file in any program works. Specifically, with __LibreOffice__, the package can open most __Microsoft Word__ documents and spreadsheets.

#### **Remote Files**
This service allows a __LibreOffice__ user to upload his/her file to a remote server or cloud-based storage site (such as __Google Drive__ or __Dropbox__) so that it can be worked on from different locations and from different computers.

#### **Recent Files**
This tab shows several of the most recent documents opened within a __LibreOffice__ program. 

### **Templates**

#### **CREATE** (What is each option? What would you compare them to?)

#### **Writer Document**
This is similar to a __Microsoft Word__ document; however, __LibreOffice__ does not save documents in the same format that __Microsoft Word does__ **(.docx)**. Instead, **__LibreOffice__ utilizes the Open Document File (.odf)** to save documents. __LibreOffice__ also has similar text-editing tools to __Microsoft Word__ and a variety of other options for modifying a document, such as formatting options, text and design styles, the ability to create and insert tables, spell checking software, word count, and other tools that would be expected within a word-processor. Has extensive WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) word processing capabilities.

#### **Calc Spreadsheet**
This spreadsheet application serves as an open-source alternative to programs like __Microsoft Excel__ and __Google Sheets__. The program is similar to __Excel 07__, in terms of features and design.

#### **Impress Presentation**
This is the __LibreOffice__ version of __Microsoft Powerpoint__ or other similar presentation software. This program allows for users to create and add templates, insert images, add animations, and manage other visual design effects within the presentation. **Presentations are exported as SWF files**, which allow any computer with __Adobe Flash Player__ to view the file. 

#### **Draw Drawing**
Similar to __Microsoft Visio__. This is **a vector graphics editor and diagramming tool** that is compatible to __CorelDRAW__. This aspect of LibreOffice is not applicable to the chosen project. 

#### **Math Formula**
Application designed for the user to create and edit mathematical formulas. This aspect of __LibreOffice__ is not applicable to the chosen project. 

#### **Base Database**
Allows the user to create and manage databases and reports that provides the user easy access to data. Very similar to __Microsoft Access__. This aspect of __LibreOffice__ is not applicable to the chosen project.
